mbedrpc.py

Thomas 'nezza-_-' Roth, code@stacksmashing.net, http://stacksmashing.net/

This is an improved version of the RPC module available here:
http://mbed.org/cookbook/Interfacing-with-Python

This version tries to remove the repeating stuff and adds some functionality:
- pins[] is a list containing all pins on the mbed:
  Use pins[0] to access LED 1 and pins[4] to access pin 5

- Be a little more don't-repeat-yourself:
  The code uses subclassing to remove some repeating stuff

- Make the code more clean:
  Instead of defining each pin by hand, generate them by two loops.
